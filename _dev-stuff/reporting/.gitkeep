# Reporting Tools' Reports & Technical Information

Folder [_dev-stuff/reporting/][def] is intended for holding  reporting tools' results or any technical information about the project.

## Why use a `.gitkeep` file ?

As [Git doesn't track empty directories][def2], adding a`.gitkeep` file to a directory is a way to ensure that it will not be ignored when empty and, thus, that the integrity of the filesystem's tree will be preserved throughout the whole development cycle.

In this template, `.gitkeep` files are further used to document the filesystem's architecture, reason why each folder, whether empty or not, holds such a file. Letting your own directories also sytematically hold a  `.gitkeep` file is strongly recommended.
