# Development Resources

Folder [_dev-notes/resources/][def] is intended for holding resources helpful for the project's development or its maintenance. Typical content includes external references or tutorials, set of icons, snippets or tools in the form of apps, calculators or scripts running specific actions on the code itself.

## Why use a `.gitkeep` file ?

As [Git doesn't track empty directories][def2], adding a`.gitkeep` file to a directory is a way to ensure that it will not be ignored when empty and, thus, that the integrity of the filesystem's tree will be preserved throughout the whole development cycle.

In this template, `.gitkeep` files are further used to document the filesystem's architecture, reason why each folder, whether empty or not, holds such a file. Letting your own directories also sytematically hold a  `.gitkeep` file is strongly recommended.
