# Safety Backups and Temporary Backups

Folder [_dev-stuff/backups/][def] is intended for holding  backups. Typical uses of this folder include (temporarly) holding a "safety copy" of (all or part of the) project until a critical modification is confirmed to not need a rollback and keeping an easily available copy of deprcated, yet possibly usefull again, stuff. This folder should be monitored and cleaned on a regular basis.

## Why use a `.gitkeep` file ?

As [Git doesn't track empty directories][def2], adding a`.gitkeep` file to a directory is a way to ensure that it will not be ignored when empty and, thus, that the integrity of the filesystem's tree will be preserved throughout the whole development cycle.

In this template, `.gitkeep` files are further used to document the filesystem's architecture, reason why each folder, whether empty or not, holds such a file. Letting your own directories also sytematically hold a  `.gitkeep` file is strongly recommended.
