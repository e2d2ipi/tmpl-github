# Devlopment's Roadmaps

Folder [_dev-stuff/roadmaps/][def] is intended for holding information about the future of the software. This includes _Todoes_, _Comments_ and _Suggestions_. This folder's content **should be monitored before starting any new feature** to check whether more useful/more urgent devlopments were planned. It is highly recommended that every feature that is staged and put in  [_dev-stuff/staged-stuff/][def2] is referred to in this folder.

## Why use a `.gitkeep` file ?

As [Git doesn't track empty directories][def3], adding a`.gitkeep` file to a directory is a way to ensure that it will not be ignored when empty and, thus, that the integrity of the filesystem's tree will be preserved throughout the whole development cycle.

In this template, `.gitkeep` files are further used to document the filesystem's architecture, reason why each folder, whether empty or not, holds such a file. Letting your own directories also sytematically hold a  `.gitkeep` file is strongly recommended.
