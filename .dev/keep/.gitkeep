# Worth Keeping Stuff

Folder  [.dev/keep/](../.dev/keep/) is intended for holding  unused stuff considered worth keeping. Typical content includes abandonned, yet pertinent, pieces of developments, temporarily removed parts of the project or old/deprecated versions, part or whole of which may be used or revived in the future.

## Why use a `.gitkeep` file ?

As [Git doesn't track empty directories](https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Git_FAQ#Can_I_add_empty_directories.3F), adding a`.gitkeep` file to a directory is a way to ensure that it will not be ignored when empty and, thus, that the integrity of the filesystem's tree will be preserved throughout the whole development cycle.

In this template, `.gitkeep` files are further used to document the filesystem's architecture, reason why each folder, whether empty or not, holds such a file. Letting your own directories also sytematically hold a  `.gitkeep` file is strongly recommended.
