# Todos & Notes

Folder  [.todo/](../.todo/) is intended for **locally** holding todos and (hot) notes concerning the project. Making it a standalone folder at root level ensure it is eyecatching and its content won't be forgotten.

## Why use a `.gitkeep` file ?

As [Git doesn't track empty directories](https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Git_FAQ#Can_I_add_empty_directories.3F), adding a`.gitkeep` file to a directory is a way to ensure that it will not be ignored when empty and, thus, that the integrity of the filesystem's tree will be preserved throughout the whole development cycle.

In this template, `.gitkeep` files are further used to document the filesystem's architecture, reason why each folder, whether empty or not, holds such a file. Letting your own directories also sytematically hold a  `.gitkeep` file is strongly recommended.
