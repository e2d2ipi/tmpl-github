# Project's Documentation

Folder [docs /](../docs/) is intended for holding the project's documetation which can consists in a set of independent files or a whole website, as in the case of auto-generated code documentation. In any case, the content of this folder is meant to be **public**. Protected or private documentation should be stored in [_dev-stuff/dev-docs/](../_dev-stuff/dev-docs).

## Why use a`.gitkeep` file ?

As [Git doesn't track empty directories](https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Git_FAQ#Can_I_add_empty_directories.3F), adding a`.gitkeep` file to a directory is a way to ensure that it will not be ignored when empty and, thus, that the integrity of the filesystem's tree will be preserved throughout the whole development cycle.

In this template, `.gitkeep` files are further used to document the filesystem's architecture, reason why each folder, whether empty or not, holds such a file. Letting your own directories also sytematically hold a  `.gitkeep` file is strongly recommended.
